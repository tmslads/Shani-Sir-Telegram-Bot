# Shani Sir Telegram Bot
A Shani Sir Telegram bot who is savage in groups, sends you clips of Sir, and can get up close and personal with you in the DMs!

Chat with him now: @shanisirbot

## Commands available:
The following commands are currently available to use:

1. `/start` - Start the bot! (Highly recommended)
2. `/help` - General help and information about the bot.
3. `/facts` - Get a random fact from the internet.
4. `/8ball` - Magic 8 ball on messages. Usage: reply to a message with /8ball, or just type /8ball and then type the question.
5. `/snake` - A roast
6. `/tell` - Get more personal with the bot by providing a nickname and/or birthday, which it uses in regular conversations.
7. `/settings` - Modify the behaviour of the bot in groups and private chat. You can toggle on/off morning messages, media reactions and profanity checks. More precise control on the probability of it reacting to media and profanity will come in a later update.
8. More coming soon...

### Behaviour in groups:

* If this bot is added to a group, it will try and behave like an actual user and reply to media sent (40% of the time) with some reactions.
* The bot will also check for profanity (20% of the time) and will suggest to stop using it.
* If any user replies to a message from the bot, it will reply to the user just like it would in private chat. The only difference is that here it does not learn from your replies.
* The bot will reply to the user if he is mentioned (@) in the message.

### Behaviour in private chat:

* In private, the bot becomes a chatbot and tries to simulate a real life conversation.
* The bot also learns from your conversation and might use it to improve the quality of future conversations.
* If one or more emojis are present, the bot will also add that many number of random emojis to its reply.
* It still reacts to media files just like in groups.

### Inline mode:
This bot will give you clips from [Shanisirmodule](https://github.com/tmslads/Shanisirmodule), @ the bot and type a name of a clip and click on a result to send it to the target chat as a mp3 file.
