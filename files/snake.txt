**You're such a snake.**

**So much so, that I wish you were a recursive Python function; you would finally be able to execute() yourself. Unfortunately though, you serve no function in society.**
**I know you try: your hardest, but you're always the Exception to "it's common sense!". You're two faced like a Queue, and if I gathered documentation for all your errors, a bit of garbage collection, I would return with quite a thicc Stack.**
**This message to you is just me emptying my life's Recycle Bin.**
**In conclusion then, either uninstall this ego of yours or get Alt-F4ed by me, your Task Manager.**
**Seriously; if you keep this up, the only thing you'll be printing to the console is "Goodbye world!". Commit to changing yourself, or else: no Pull Request will save you from me.**

#I initialize you

#And I can destroy you #as well
#you.destroy()

**#Don't make me.**
